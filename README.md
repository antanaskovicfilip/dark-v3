# Dark+ V3 theme for Visual Studio Code
It's a personal upgrade for the Dark+ V2 Experimental theme from VSCode.

---
## Per lanugage syntax
Per language customization is missing; as of writing, I've only customized a few things for C++, because I was using it at the time. <br> More custimizations for C++ will come when the need arises. <br> More language support will come when I use those languages.
<br><br>
Feel free to fork the repository and make it your own.

Languages supported so far:

| Language | Support |
|----------|---------|

## How to install
1. Clone the repository into your `.vscode/extensions/` folder;
```sh
git clone https://github.com/antanaskovicfilip/dark-v3.git ~/.vscode/extensions
```
2. If VSCode is running, terminate it and start it again. The theme should be listed both in the Extentions category and drop down panel, when you enter the theme shortcut.

## Todo
In no particular order:
- Fine tune C++ support
- Add C support
- Add Python support
- Add JavaScript support
- Add screenshots
