# Dark+ V3 theme for Visual Studio Code
~It's a personal upgrade for the Dark+ V2 Experimental theme from VSCode.~ <br>
It started as a personal upgrade for the Dark+ V2 Experimental theme from VSCode, but has become everything but.

## Per language syntax
Per language customization is missing; as of writing, I've only customized a few things for C++, because I was using it at the time. <br> More custimizations for C++ will come when the need arises. <br> More language support will come when I use those languages.
<br><br>
Feel free to fork the repository and make it your own.

Languages supported so far:

| Language   | Support     |
|------------|-------------|
| C++        | **Partial** |
| C          | **Partial** |
| Python     | **None**    |
| JavaScript | **Partial**    |
|            |             |

*Note:* I don't think I'll label any language's support as complete, as there may be tokens I'm still unfamiliar with. But, conerning my use case, 'Partial' is pretty much complete.

## How to install
1. Clone the repository into your `.vscode/extensions/` folder;
```sh
git clone https://github.com/antanaskovicfilip/dark-v3.git ~/.vscode/extensions
```
2. If VSCode is running, terminate it and start it again. The theme should be listed both in the Extentions category and drop down panel, when you enter the theme shortcut.

*Note:* this didn't work on my Linux machine; it never showed up in VSCode and I wasn't able to use it. Haven't yet figured out why and I don't know when I will.

## Todo
In no particular order:
- Fine tune C++ support
- Fine tune C support
- Add Python support
- Fine tune JavaScript support
- Add screenshots
